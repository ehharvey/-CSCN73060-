# Introduction 
This repo houses code for a class project. This project involved maintaining existing C++ client and server code that communicated over TCP.

At a high level, this is the work we achieved:
1. Migrated build system to Bazel from MSBuild
2. Replaced socket code with Boost
3. Macro-driven performance timing that outputted results to JSON
